          Setting Up Your League
        </h3>
        <p>
          When you first open the application, you'll see the team selection
          screen. Here you can:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>Add teams (up to 20) using the "Add Team" button</li>
          <li>Remove teams using the trash icon (minimum 2 teams required)</li>
          <li>Customize team names by typing in the input fields</li>
          <li>
            Adjust team strengths using the sliders (higher strength = better
            performance)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded-lg border border-blue-200 mb-4">
          <p class="font-semibold text-blue-800">Pro Tip:</p>
          <p>
            Team strength significantly affects match outcomes. A team with 100
            strength will generally perform better than a team with 50 strength.
          </p>
        </div>

        <p>
          Once you're happy with your teams, click the "Start League" button to
          begin the simulation.

        <h4 class="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-600 mt-4">Match History</h4>
        <p>

          Customizing Match Outcomes

        <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4">
          <li>
            Find the match you want to edit in the current week or match history

          <li>Click the pencil icon next to the match</li>
          <li>In the dialog that appears, adjust the goals for each team</li>
          <li>Click "Save" to update the result</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          After editing a match result, the league standings will automatically
          recalculate to reflect the changes. This includes updating points,
          goal differences, and championship probabilities.

          Understanding the League System

            <strong>Points System:</strong>

          Championship Determination
        </h4>
        <p>
          The team with the most points at the end of all matches is declared
          the champion. After the 4th week, the system will calculate and
          display championship probabilities for each team based on their
          current performance and remaining matches.

            Note on Championship Probabilities:
          </p>
          <p>
            These probabilities are calculated based on current standings, team
            strengths, and remaining matches. They're updated after each match
            and when results are edited.
